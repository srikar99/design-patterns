# design-patterns

This project contains the design patterns explained in the book **Head First Design Patterns**.

An excellent video series for this is available on youtube by Christopher Okhravi: [Design Patterns in Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ejT8FO-7I&list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc)
